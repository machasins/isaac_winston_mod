This mod simply plays a Winston voiceline, "Hi There", whenever the trinket Monkey Paw appears.

Can be configured with [Mod Config Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2681875787) to adjust when the sound plays and how loud it is.

Thanks to [Lazy Mattman](https://www.youtube.com/@lazymattman) for inspiration and [shart](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2924047210) for the inital mod.
